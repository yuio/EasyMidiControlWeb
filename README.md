Usually I watch TV while playing the guitar on my couch. I process my guitar signal using a Tonex effects pedal that supports 'Program Change' via MIDI (in my case via USB) to choose the preset, so I decided to create this application to be able to do it remotely from a tablet or mobile phone.

This application is actually useful for any MIDI device and can be used directly from the web browser, so it does not require installation:
